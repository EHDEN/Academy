# Content

A Moodle courses consists of two major components.
- **Activities** are resources such as *Pages*, *Quizzes* or *Files* that a student can interact with and contribute to.
- **Sections** are used to organise *Activities* into major topics of the a course.

## Activities

To avoid confusion for the student we have decided that there shall be only three activities used throughout a course.
- **Page** activity to present course information in the form of text or a video.
- **Quiz** activity for knowledge checkers and examinations.
- **File** activity to share small files (< 5MB) with the student

Please avoid the use of other activities wherever possible.
