# ACADEMY

This repository contains material for the EHDEN Academy (https://academy.ehden.eu) that is currently under development by the team.

**The EHDEN Academy** is an e-learning environment that is being developed by the European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) project (www.ehden.eu). Its aim is to train all stakeholders in the project in the use of the tools and processes that are being adopted in EHDEN. Course development on the OMOP Common Data Model and the rich set of tools developed in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) project are developed in collaboration with that community (See www.ohdsi.org for more information).
